# WDI-Group-Project-TaskManager
TaskManager is an application which helps people either source for help, or source for small jobs. It is done as part of Project 3 under General Assembly Singapore's Web Development Immersive.<br />

This is a group project. The other two members are: https://github.com/tengchoonhong90 and https://github.com/scottosan .<br />

 The project was created via Ruby on Rails. I was mainly in charge of the CRUD functionality for matters relating to tasks and the acceptance of tasks. Later, I also implemented a chat function using Pusher.

# About
Taskmanager serves two groups of people.<br />

The first group are people who have disposable income, yet find themselves having too little time to settle minor tasks.<br />
The second group includes people who have the capacity to help the first group for a small fee.<br />

Taskmanager will provide a online and secure portal for these groups. Members for the first group will be able to post tasks on a public 'board' of sorts. Members of the second group will be able to view said tasks via a map, and apply accordingly for the task.
