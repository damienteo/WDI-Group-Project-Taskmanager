# taskmanager

##About
```
Taskmanager serves two groups of people.

The first group are people who have disposable income, yet find themselves having too little time to settle minor tasks.
The second group includes people who have the capacity to help the first group for a small fee.

Taskmanager will provide a online and secure portal for these groups. Members for the first group will be able to post tasks on a public 'board' of sorts. Members of the second group will be able to view said tasks via a map, and apply accordingly for the task.
```

##Technical Requirements

```
Use Ruby on Rails and Active Record to build an application
Create an application using at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
Include all major CRUD functions for at least one of those models
Craft thoughtful user stories together, as a team
Manage team contributions and collaboration using a standard Git flow on Github
Layout and style front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS, with or without a framework.
Deploy application online so it's publically accessible
```

## The app should also have:

```
Front-end with HTML & Javascript
Authentication to restrict access to appropriate users
```

##Necessary Deliverables
```
A working app, built by the whole team, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
A team git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from every team member dating back to the very beginning of the project.
A readme.md file with:
Explanations of the technologies used
A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
Installation instructions for any dependencies
Link to your user stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
